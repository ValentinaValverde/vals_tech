      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I enjoy UI/UX work as well as frontend development, though I am skilled
        in fullstack applications. Small, fast-paced environments with
        opportunity for growth catch my eye, and I have experience working on
        small teams as well as directly with clients. I am open to work on
        projects of any size or even test features on a new product! Don't be
        shy!
